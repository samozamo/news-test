# Information

Node version: 20.11.1

I've left the Nuxt starter readme in here for any scripts you might need below.

I've gone for a very minimal design for this project, with only a few styles used, but enough for it to not look horrendous (I think).

## User story 1

On first page load you are welcomed by a title, a list of countries to select from, and a small user message.

## User story 2

After you've selected a country, 5 headlines are retrieved and displayed. I have chosen to display the headline, author and it's source. As an addition the user can also click through to the main article.
